This is a straight forward Plugin that does not require the use of any shortcodes or widgets. Simply head for Settings > WFS Let It Snow and configure your snow flurry! This plugin makes use of Jason Brown's brilliant jQuery plugin [Snowfall](http://loktar00.github.io/JQuery-Snowfall/), all credit for the snow effect must go to Jason!

There is a really good chance this plugin will work with earlier versions of WordPress, but the chances are an active site will be at WordPress 4.0 or higher anyway.
